# Shadow Time Hypothesis

**Proposed by:** *Hasnain Ali*  
**Field:** ICS Physical Engineering | Hafiz-e-Quran | Naat Khuwan  

Shadow Time Hypothesis is a metaphysical theory that explores the state of reality *before time began*. It merges Islamic metaphysics with modern cosmological thought to propose a pre-Big Bang zone where potential existence awaited collapse into reality.

## ðŸŒŒ Core Concepts

- **Timeless Zone:** Before Big Bang, no time or matter existed â€” just uncollapsed possibilities.
- **Divine Collapse:** Reality began when Divine command initiated creation (e.g., *Kun fa-yakoon*).
- **Islamic Echo:** Referenced in Quran [76:1] â€” "Has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing even mentioned?"

## ðŸ“– Quranic Reflection

> *"Has there not come upon man a period of time, when he was not a thing [even] mentioned?"* â€” Quran 76:1
