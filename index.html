        <h2>🌌 What is Shadow Time?</h2>
        <p>
            Shadow Time is the hypothesized metaphysical realm that existed before the Big Bang. It is not governed by linear time, space, or physical matter.
            Instead, it is a zone of infinite possibilities — where everything that could exist was only in potential form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time as we know it began only when one reality collapsed into existence at the Big Bang — triggered by divine command: <strong>“Kun fa-yakoon”</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>📖 Islamic Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>Quran (Surah Al-Insan 76:1)</strong> — "Has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing [even] mentioned?"</p>
        <p><strong>Surah Al-Anbiya 21:30</strong> — "Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, then We separated them?"</p>
        <p>Shadow Time reflects concepts like <strong>Lauh-e-Mahfooz</strong> — where all possibilities are written before manifesting in our timeline.</p>

        <h2>🧠 Theory Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> Non-linear, only potential existed.</li>
            <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Undefined until collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Big Bang:</strong> Trigger point for chosen timeline.</li>
        </ul>
